excerpt: 'This study explores the potential application of engineered MnO2-Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) nanoheterostructures (NHs) for the simultaneous removal of nanoplastics (NPs) and bisphenol S (BPS) from polluted water, two persistent pollutants from plastic degradation that pose substantial health and ecological risks.'
