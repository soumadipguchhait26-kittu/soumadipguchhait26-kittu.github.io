excerpt: 'This study investigated the interaction of Tire-wear particles (TWPs) with Zinc-Oxide nanoparticles (ZNPs) and studied their individual and combined toxic effects on Chlorella vulgaris in the co-presence of Humics. Physiological parameters, including growth, photosynthetic pigments, oxidative stress, and membrane damage, were analysed using Flow cytometry.'
