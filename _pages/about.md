# Welcome 

Currently, I am investigating how **mineral–contaminant interactions** influence processes like **nanoplastic encapsulation, contaminant sorption, and mineral dissolution**, using a combination of **spectroscopy, microscopy, and advanced chemometric and analytical tools (e.g., PARAFAC analysis)**.  

This website provides an overview of my research journey, including:  
- 📄 **Publications** – peer-reviewed articles and ongoing work  
- 🎤 **Talks & Presentations** – invited talks, conference contributions, and outreach  
- 👨‍🏫 **Teaching & Mentorship** – academic teaching and student engagement  
- 🧪 **Research Highlights** – recent projects, collaborations, and findings  

I am passionate about developing **sustainable approaches to mitigate anthropogenic contaminants** and contributing to a cleaner, more resilient environment.  

Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out via [email](mailto:soumadipguchhait26@gmail.com).

My research is driven by one overarching question:  
**How do emerging anthropogenic pollutants move through natural systems, what role do minerals play in their transport, and what is their ultimate environmental fate?**  

Understanding this question is crucial to predicting pollutant behaviour and designing strategies for their mitigation.

### 🔬 Research Focus  

My work investigates the **interactions between minerals and emerging pollutants** such as nanoplastics and pharmaceuticals. By integrating **spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemometric tools**, I aim to uncover how these pollutants are transported, transformed, or encapsulated in mineral matrices.  

#### 1️⃣ Encapsulation of Nanoplastics into Minerals  
- Studying how **nanoplastics are entrapped within growing calcite structures** during mineral precipitation.  
- Exploring how **pH changes** influence the **release or retention of nanoplastics**.  
- Assessing the role of **humic acid and other natural organic matter** in controlling encapsulation efficiency.  

#### 2️⃣ Sorption of Pharmaceuticals onto Minerals  
- Investigating the **interaction of tetracycline (TC)** with **goethite** surfaces.  
- Identified new vibrational features (FTIR & Raman) suggesting **cation–π interactions**.  
- Evaluating how surfactants and co-contaminants alter sorption capacity and pollutant stability.  

#### 3️⃣ Transport & Environmental Fate  
- Understanding **how minerals mediate pollutant transport** across different environmental compartments (soil, water, sediments).  
- Predicting **long-term stability and release mechanisms** of encapsulated pollutants.  

#### 4️⃣ Development of Sustainable Materials  
- Designing and synthesising **eco-friendly, mineral-based hybrid materials** to capture and immobilize emerging contaminants.  
- Exploring **green and scalable approaches** to pollutant remediation in aquatic environments.
